# Preview 
The technology of three-dimensional (3D) printing of biological materials is an 
emerging field that combines biotechnology with advanced printing 
technology. This meeting of the two disciplines has the potential to 
fundamentally change the way objects and biological materials are produced. 
With a widening range of applications, from medicine to scientific research and 
industry, this technology brings a wealth of prospects and challenges. In this 
paper, we report the current status and future prospects in the field of 3D 
printing of biological materials. First, reference is made to the creation of 3D 
bioprinting and its importance in the scientific field. Then, reference is made 
to various ways of 3D printing and the materials used. Also, 3D printing types 
are compared and applications based on annealing, photopolymerization, and 
droplets are reported. Finally, challenges faced and future goals are 
mentioned.
